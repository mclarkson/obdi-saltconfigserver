To supply a description\r\nthat will be shown in the Web Interface, the administrator adds comments at the top of\r\neach state file containing the description. The format is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# INFO: A description for this state file\r\n# INFO: that can span multiple lines\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Datacentres and environments\r\n\r\nSaved on each server as the grains: dc and env.\r\n\r\n#### GIT Versioning\r\n\r\nSaved on each server as the grain: version.\r\n\r\nenvironment_\\<semantic-version\\>\r\n\r\nFor example, test_0.1.123 or prod_1.0.27\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n#### Installing the plugin\r\n\r\nRefer to [obdi-salt-repository](https://github.com/mclarkson/obdi-salt-repository) and [Obdi Plugins](https://github.com/mclarkson/obdi/blob/master/doc/plugins.md) to install this plugin.\r\n\r\n## System configuration\r\n\r\n## Dev\r\n\r\n![](doc/Salt_ENC_DB_Schema.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n",
